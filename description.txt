(For 1.4.4)
Adds some QoL changes from Calamity to vanilla. Feel free to suggest other QoL changes as well, not just Calamity ones! I am happy to implement them.

It adds:
 - Town NPCs selling potions and materials like in Calamity
 - Reducing respawn timer to 3 seconds if no boss is alive
 - Starter Bag (only with vanilla items)
 - Removing the Expert Mode regeneration penalty.
 - Recipes for early-game accessories.
All features are toggleable in the config.
